# Design Methodology: [Prompt Name]

## Design Goal

[A sentence or two on what you were trying to achieve and who the prompt is for.]

---

## Design Approach: Structure and Technique

Explain the two design choices behind your prompt and why they fit the task.

**Structure I used:** [A lesson framework, a modified framework, or your own structure, for example: C-A-R-E, a modified R-T-F, or a custom Context/Task/Constraints/Format layout.]

**Why this structure fits my task:**
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**Technique I used:** [Zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, or zero-shot chain-of-thought.]

**Why this technique fits my task:**
[For example: I used few-shot because the AI needed to copy a specific tone, so I gave it two sample outputs. Or: I used zero-shot chain-of-thought because the task needs step-by-step logic but I did not have examples, so I added "Think through this step by step before you answer."]

**Example of modifying a framework (delete if not relevant):**
I started from R-T-F (Role, Task, Format) and added two parts. I added a **Constraints** part to stop the model from making pricing claims, and an **Example** part to lock in the tone I wanted. My final structure was Role, Task, Constraints, Example, Format. Each added part solved a specific problem the plain framework left open.

## Part-by-Part Justification

Justify each part of your prompt: what it is, what goes in it, and why the prompt needs it. If your prompt is technique-driven and short (for example zero-shot chain-of-thought), justify the technique and the few parts you do have instead.

| Part | What I put here | Why the prompt needs it |
|------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| [Part 1] | [Your text] | [Reason] |
| [Part 2] | [Your text] | [Reason] |
| [Part 3] | [Your text] | [Reason] |

## Testing and Iteration

Test your prompt against a naive baseline, a plain version of the same request with no deliberate structure or technique, and refine it based on what you see.

**Baseline I compared against:**
```
[Your plain, naive version of the same request]
```

| Version | Result / score | What changed |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Naive baseline | [result] | [notes] |
| Version 1 | [result] | [notes] |
| Final | [result] | [notes] |

**What testing showed:** [In your own words, how your designed prompt performed compared to the baseline, and what you changed as a result.]

**What I learned:** [What this taught you about prompt design.]

## Strengths and Limitations

**Works well when:** [The conditions where this prompt performs best.]
**Struggles when:** [Where it breaks down, and why.]
**Would improve next:** [What you would refine with more time.]
